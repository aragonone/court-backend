# Court Backend services

This repo provides a set of background services in charge of those parts of Aragon Court that can be done automatically to ensure a good user experience for the users of the court.

## Workers

It provides the following list of worker services:
- [`Heartbeat`](./src/workers/heartbeat.js): It will try to update the court in case it is outdated. Configured initially to run one time per hour indefinitely.
- [`Reveals`](./src/workers/reveal.js): It will try to execute all the reveals requested by the users. Configured initially to run one time per minute indefinitely.
- [`Disputes`](./src/workers/disputes.js): It will scan the Ethereum blockchain looking for new created disputes that will serve the `settlements` worker afterward. Configured initially to run one time every 5 minutes indefinitely.
- [`Settlements`](./src/workers/settlements.js): It will try to execute and settle penalties, rewards, and appeals for all the rounds of a dispute if possible. Configured initially to run one time per minute indefinitely.

## Setup

First clone this repo and install dependencies:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/aragonone/court-backend/
cd court-backend
npm i
npx lerna bootstrap
````

The services will use the same database required by the backend server, then first make sure you server is up and running correctly. 
To do that simply create your own `.env` file in `packages/server`, feel free to follow the template provided in `/packages/server/.env.sample`.
Once you have done that, make sure you have postgres installed and running and simply run the following commands:

```bash
cd packages/server
npx sequelize db:create
npx sequelize db:migrate
npm start
```

Finally, in another console run the background services as follows:

```bash
cd court-backend/packages/services
npm start
```

## Config

### Workers

All the background services are configured through the `config.js` file using the following variables:
- `name`: Name of the worker used for logging. It will assume `unknown` if undefined.
- `path`: Name of the root file that will be executed every time a new job for that worker is executed. This parameter is mandatory, and it must be a file exporting an async function accepting the following list of parameters: `worker`, `job`, `tries`, `logger`.
- `processes`: Number of workers run in parallel. It will assume `1` if undefined.
- `times`: Number of jobs that will be run for each worker, use `0` to denote unlimited. It will assume `1` if undefined.
- `repeat`: The number of seconds that the worker will wait until a new job is created. It will assume `0` if undefined.

### Keys

This repo is using `@aragon/truffle-config-v5`, it is not using Truffle, but truffle config to load the network configuration following the standard way provided by Truffle.
Thus, keys are fetched from `~/.aragon/${NETWORK}_key.json` files.
