### Local

To test Aragon Court locally please do the following tasks:

##### 1. Install Ganache and The Graph
First, make sure you have both Ganache and Graph CLIs
 
```bash
  npm install -g ganache-cli
  npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

##### 2. Start Ganache node
Start a local ganache in a separate terminal with the following params:

```bash
  ganache-cli -h 0.0.0.0 -i 15 --gasLimit 8000000 --deterministic
```

##### 3. Start Graph node
In another terminal, clone the graph node and start it:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/
  cd graph-node/docker
  npm i
  rm -rf data
  docker-compose up
```

> If docker prompts you with the error `The reorg threshold 50 is larger than the size of the chain 7, you probably want to set the ETHEREUM_REORG_THRESHOLD environment variable to 0`, 
  simply add a new env variable in `docker-compose.yml` named `ETHEREUM_REORG_THRESHOLD` assigning it to 0 and start it again.

##### 4. Deploy local Aragon Court instance
To deploy a local instance run the following commands on a separate terminal:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aragon/aragon-network-deploy/
  cd aragon-network-deploy
  npm i
  npm run deploy:court:rpc
```

##### 5. Deploy Aragon Court subgraph
You can use the provided deployment script to create a manifest file with the providing the court deployed address as follows:

```bash
  ./scripts/deploy NETWORK=rpc COURT==<COURT_ADDRESS>
``` 

##### 6. Populate Aragon Court
You can use Aragon Court's backend CLI to start playing with your deployed instance.
First, open a separate terminal, clone this repo and install dependencies:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aragonone/court-backend/
  cd court-backend
  npm i
  npx lerna bootstrap
```

Finally, make sure you set the local court address in `packages/cli/truffle-config.js`.
You can now start playing with the available CLI commands:

- `mint`: Mint ANJ or Fee tokens for a certain address
- `heartbeat`: Mint ANJ or Fee tokens for a certain address
- `stake`: Stake ANJ tokens for a juror
- `unstake`: Unstake ANJ tokens
- `activate`: Activate ANJ to the Court
- `deactivate`: Deactivate ANJ from the Court
- `arbitrable`: Create new Arbitrable instance for the Court
- `subscribe`: Subscribe Arbitrable instance to the Court
- `dispute`: Create dispute submitting evidence
- `draft`: Draft dispute and close evidence submission period if necessary
- `commit`: Commit vote for a dispute round
- `reveal`: Reveal committed vote
- `appeal`: Appeal dispute in favour of a certain outcome
- `confirm-appeal`: Confirm an existing appeal for a dispute
- `settle-round`: Settle penalties and appeals for a dispute
- `settle-juror`: Settle juror for a dispute
- `execute`: Execute ruling for a dispute

You can also use the `rpc:setup` NPM command to populate your local Aragon Court instance with jurors and disputes.

##### 7. Test Aragon Court's back-office app 

Optionally, you can try the back-office app to see all your actions on a UI. 
To do that, open a separate terminal on the cloned `aragon-court-backend` repo and go to the `packages/app` dir.
After that, make sure you provide a `.env` file with a GraphQL endpoint for your Aragon Court subgraph before starting the app.
For example, the next `.env` file will work for a local environment:

```bash
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/aragon/aragon-court-rpc
```

Alternatively, if you want to re-use one of the already deployed instances, you can simply specify a network name:

```bash
REACT_APP_NETWORK=rinkeby
```

Finally, you can simply run `npm start` to start playing with it.
